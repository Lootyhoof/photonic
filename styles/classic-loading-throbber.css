/* Photonic - use "classic" loading throbber
 *
 * This style allows to use pre-Photon (spinning) loading throbbers
 * in various parts of the interface, instead of the Photon "back and forth"
 * throbber. This style will only work in the Photonic theme as the required
 * files are bundled with the theme itself.
 *
 * To install this, you can either place the contents of this style
 * into userChrome.css, or use the "Stylem" extension to create a
 * userstyle and paste this style into it, giving it a name and clicking
 * "save" to save it.
